# Metabolomics And nmR (MAR) toolbox

A collection of functions and scripts to read, process and analyse proton 1D NMR spectra.

Some examples of application of these methods can be seen in the published papers. <sup>[1](#myfootnote1),</sup> <sup>[2](#myfootnote2),</sup> <sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>

<h3> Description </h3>

Main functionalities include data import (Bruker and [nmrML](http://nmrml.org/) formats supported), preprocessing (trimming, normalisation and scaling) and peak integration. Scripts for preprocessing, multivariate analysis and visualisation are also included in the repository.
